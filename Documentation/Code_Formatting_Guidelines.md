Guidelines will have to be established by Nate and Michael.

Items to consider:

* Spaces vs tabs
* Folder nesting structure
* Linters used

Likely settled by agreed upon React practices:

* Component names are CamelCase
* Folder nesting probably should not exceed [3 or 4 levels](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#avoid-too-much-nesting)

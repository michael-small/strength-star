Guidelines will have to be established by Nate and Michael.

Items to consider:

* Spaces vs tabs
* Folder nesting structure
* Linters used

Likely settled by agreed upon React practices:

* Component names are CamelCase
* CSS `class` and `id` composite names using [hyphens ' - '](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/17au/styleguide/html-css/naming-conventions-html.html)
* Folder nesting probably should not exceed [3 or 4 levels](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#avoid-too-much-nesting)

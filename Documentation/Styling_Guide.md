# Styling Guide

Styling should utilize the power of SCSS.

Both Nate and Michael are familiar with [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), which was used in ohm-str. Nate is more familiar with Bootstrap, 
and other frameworks may be worth consideration. Michael would also argue that all CSS files should be in their 
respective component folder, rather than a single dedicated CSS folder.

Alternate styling frameworks could include [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). Nate and Michael are familiar with a variant of 
Material desisgn, via [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

# Proposed Stack

## Frontend

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

See `Styling_Guide` doc for proposed styling frameworks/libraries.

## Backend

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

[Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication with various platforms.

## Database

Either MariaDB for MySQL or MongoDB.

### Advantages of MongoDB

* A popular choice, the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-modern-application-stack-part-1-introducing-the-mean-stack) (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
* MongoDB is quite marketable in any stack.
* Nate and Michael are experienced with Mongo via [MongoDB Web Driver for Java](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S19/iteration-3-toon-squad/tree/droplet-state/server/src/main/java/umm3601).
* Despite their experience, Michael would argue that we have had less hands on 
 experience with MongoDB directly than MySQL.
* Michael is much more rusty on MySQL than MongoDB, and has taken a class using
  MongoDB [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), an "elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js".
* Flexibility with schemas.

### Advantages of MariaDB + MySQL

* Nate and Michael arguably have more experience with hands on MySQL development, and Nate has used
  it extensively in recent times.
* MySQL experience would be marketable for Nate and Michael for employers that prefer MySQL.
* Despite MongoDB's trendyness and recent demand, MySQL is still a solid choice and a proven DB solution 
  thaqt is still widely used.
* More ridgid with schemas, enforcing a structured approach.

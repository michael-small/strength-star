# Strength Star: A React Port of Ohm-Str

A weight training app originally written in Angular 2+ and [created by Nate Foss](https://github.com/nkfoss/ohm-str).
Michael Small helped with some UI adjustments and input, but never fully commited. Nate is now porting it over to React, and Michael
wanted to be there from the ground up.

*This is not intended to be the main repo for the port.* Michael is just very rusty from a month long hiatus from programming,
and a bit longer from using React. This is just a bit of a prototype to show Nate and to perhaps mess around with some libraries
that would be used in the actual project hosted by Nate.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

`npm run start`

## Documentation

React's default README encompasing how to run/build/test was moved to `Documentation/ReactStockREADME.md`. The docs also cover proposed code formatting guidlines, component hierarchy, and stack.
